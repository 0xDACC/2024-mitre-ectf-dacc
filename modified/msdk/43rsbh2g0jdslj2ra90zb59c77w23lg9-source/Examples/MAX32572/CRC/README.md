## Description

This example demonstrates the use of the HW CRC calculator.  The example first generates a CRC over 100 bytes.  The resulting CRC is inverted and placed at the end of the 100 bytes.  Another CRC is then calculated over the resulting 101 bytes.  The final result is compared with the expected value.  This sequence is repeated twice - once using the blocking CRC functions and once using the non-blocking (asynchronous) functions.


## Software

### Project Usage

Universal instructions on building, flashing, and debugging this project can be found in the **[MSDK User Guide](https://analog-devices-msdk.github.io/msdk/USERGUIDE/)**.

### Project-Specific Build Notes

(None - this project builds as a standard example)

## Required Connections

-   Connect a USB cable between the PC and the CN1 (USB/PWR) connector.
-   Open an terminal application on the PC and connect to the EV kit's console UART at 115200, 8-N-1.

## Expected Output

The Console UART of the device will output these messages:

```
Test CRC Sync
   Passed
Test CRC Async
   Passed
```
