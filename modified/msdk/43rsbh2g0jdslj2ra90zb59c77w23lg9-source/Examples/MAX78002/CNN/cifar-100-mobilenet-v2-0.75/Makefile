# ** Readme! **
# Don't edit this file! This is the core Makefile for a MaximSDK 
# project. The available configuration options can be overridden 
# in "project.mk", on the command-line, or with system environment 
# variables.

# See https://github.com/Analog-Devices-MSDK/VSCode-Maxim/tree/develop#build-configuration 
# for more detailed instructions on how to use this system.

# The detailed instructions mentioned above are easier to read than 
# this file, but the comments found in this file also outline the 
# available configuration variables. This file is organized into 
# sub-sections, some of which expose config variables.


# *******************************************************************************
# Set the target microcontroller and board to compile for.  

# Every TARGET microcontroller has some Board Support Packages (BSPs) that are 
# available for it under the MaximSDK/Libraries/Boards/TARGET folder.  The BSP 
# that gets selected is MaximSDK/Libraries/Boards/TARGET/BOARD.

# Configuration Variables:
# - TARGET : Override the default target microcontroller.  Ex: TARGET=MAX78000
# - BOARD : Override the default BSP (case sensitive).  Ex: BOARD=EvKit_V1, BOARD=FTHR_RevA

# Locate the MaximSDK

# This Makefile needs to know where to find the MaximSDK, and the MAXIM_PATH variable 
# should point to the root directory of the MaximSDK installation.  Setting this manually
# is usually only required if you're working on the command-line.

# If MAXIM_PATH is not specified, we assume the project still lives inside of the MaximSDK 
# and move up from this project's original location.

# ./
# ├─ *.h
# ├─ *.c
# ├─include (optional)
#   └─ *.h
# ├─src (optional)
#   └─ *.c

# Configuration Variables:
# - VPATH : Tell this Makefile to search additional locations for source (.c) files.
# 			You should use the "+=" operator with this option.  
#			Ex:  VPATH += your/new/path
# - IPATH : Tell this Makefile to search additional locations for header (.h) files.
# 			You should use the "+=" operator with this option.  
#			Ex:  VPATH += your/new/path
# - SRCS : Tell this Makefile to explicitly add a source (.c) file to the build.
# 			This is really only useful if you want to add a source file that isn't
#			on any VPATH, in which case you can add the full path to the file here.
#			You should use the "+=" operator with this option.
#			Ex:  SRCS += your/specific/source/file.c
# - AUTOSEARCH : Set whether this Makefile should automatically detect .c files on
#				VPATH and add them to the build.  This is enabled by default.  Set
#				to 0 to disable.  If autosearch is disabled, source files must be
#				manually added to SRCS.

#			Ex:  PROJ_CFLAGS += -Wextra
# - MFLOAT_ABI : Set the floating point acceleration level.
#			The only options are "hard", "soft", or "softfp".
#			Ex: MFLOAT_ABI = hard

# Libraries

# This section offers "toggle switches" to include or exclude the libraries that

# Configuration variables:
# - LIB_BOARD : Include the Board-Support Package (BSP) library. (Enabled by default)
# - LIB_PERIPHDRIVERS : Include the peripheral driver library.  (Enabled by default)
# - LIB_CMSIS_DSP : Include the CMSIS-DSP library.
# - LIB_CORDIO : Include the Cordio BLE library
# - LIB_FCL : Include the Free Cryptographic Library (FCL)
# - LIB_FREERTOS : Include the FreeRTOS and FreeRTOS-Plus-CLI libraries
# - LIB_LC3 : Include the Low Complexity Communication Codec (LC3) library
# - LIB_LITTLEFS : Include the "little file system" (littleFS) library
# - LIB_LWIP : Include the lwIP library
# - LIB_MAXUSB : Include the MAXUSB library
# - LIB_SDHC : Include the SDHC library
