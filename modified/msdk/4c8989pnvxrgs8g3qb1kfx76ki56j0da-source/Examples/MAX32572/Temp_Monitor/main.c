 * @details In this example the MCU is used monitor the air temperature. Temperature 
 *          readings are timestamped and placed in flash. If a reading exceeds the 
 *          user defined temperature limits a warning message will be printed to the 
 *          terminal and the red warning light will begin to flash.
