## Description

This example demonstates the CLI commands feature of FreeRTOS and various features of the Flash Controller (page erase and write). In the terminal window, type the command that you wish to execute. The available commands are "write" (writes a text string to flash), "read" (reads text from flash) and "erase" (erases the flash page being operated on.) For more details on how to input these commands, enter "help" in the terminal window.

*** NOTE ***: Attempting to overwrite flash will return error. If you want to overwrite an address you must first erase.
