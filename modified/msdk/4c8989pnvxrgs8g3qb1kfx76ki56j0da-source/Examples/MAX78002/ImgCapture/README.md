# ImgCapture

![Example Image Capture in VSCode](res/Example-Capture.png)
(Above:  352x352 capture of a test pattern using the MAX78000FTHR's OV7692 camera)

## Description

This example demonstrates how to capture an image using the PCIF peripheral and Camera drivers.  It also demonstrates a method for collecting high resolution images and sending them to any arbitrary output destination, such as a UART interface or SD card.  

Collecting images can be a challenge when dealing with low-power CMOS camera sensors, which usually don't have memory buffers of any significant size.  Most will internally buffer a single row and then immediately stream it out to a high-speed Parallel Camera Interface (PCIF).  As a result, exposure time is proportional to the clock speed of the camera.  Therefore, the host microcontroller must be able to process, forward, and/or store the incoming image data within the strict timing limitations imposed by the camera module.  The limited general purpose SRAM size of microcontrollers make alternate output destinations (host PC, external memory, SD card, etc.) attractive, but these often have much lower bandwidth than the PCIF peripheral.  Slowing the PCIF clock speed can work for these, but is not an ideal solution because of the relationship between clock speed and exposure time.

In order to collect useful high resolution images, the data SRAM in the MAX78000/MAX78002's CNN accelerator is stitched into a virtually contiguous data buffer.  **This is not the correct way to load data for ML inferences**, but it allows high resolution images to be buffered.  From there, the data can then be forwarded on to any secondary destination by the host firmware.  The implementation can be found in [src/cnn_memutils.h](src/cnn_memutils.h).  High-level usage examples for supported output destinations can be found in [src/main.c](src/main.c).

The example can perform standard blocking captures up to the memory limits of the device, and streaming DMA captures (using cnn_memutils) up to 352x352, including QVGA (320x240) at max camera clock speeds.  Image captures are controlled from a host PC running [utils/console.py](utils/console.py).

It supports the following output destinations:

* Transmit image to a host PC.

* Save image to SD card. (MAX7800FTHR only)

## Software

### Project Usage

Universal instructions on building, flashing, and debugging this project can be found in the **[MSDK User Guide](https://analog-devices-msdk.github.io/msdk/USERGUIDE/)**.

### Console Interface & Utilites

For more details on running the serial console, converting images, and excercising the example with serial commands, see [utils/README.md](utils/README.md)

### Project-Specific Build Notes

#### Enabling Firmware Features

Firmware features can be toggled in [project.mk](project.mk).

* The console is enabled by default.  It will wait for a valid connection from [utils/console.py](utils/console.py) on startup.  Toggle the console with the `CONSOLE` variable in [project.mk](project.mk)

* SD card functionality is disabled by default.  It will attempt to mount the SD card on startup using the FAT32 format.  If it detects a blank card has been inserted (the drive name is empty) then it will attempt to format the card to FAT32.  Toggle the SD card functionality with the `SD` variable in [project.mk](project.mk)

    ![HM0360_320_240](res/HM0360_320_240.png)

11. Decrease image resolution and recapture.  The HM0360 requires switching the active context to one that has been configured for the target resolution.

    The active context is selected via register `0x3024`.

    * `0x3024 = 0` shows Context A is active (320x240).
    * `0x3024 = 1` show Context B is active (160x120).

    ```shell
    $ get-reg 0x3024

    MCU: Camera reg 0x3024=0x0
    ```

    To change to Context B (160x120):

    ```shell
    $ set-reg 0x3024 1

    MCU: Writing 0x1 to camera reg 0x3024

This quick-start is applicable for the [HM0360-AWA](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/himax/HM0360-AWA/14109822) **color** sensor.  In practice, this is the same sensor hardware as the "MWA" mono variant but with a bayer-patterned color filter.  As a result, de-bayering and color-correction functions are required to reproduce the image.

1. Set `CAMERA=HM0360_COLOR` in [project.mk](project.mk)

2. [Clean and rebuild](.vscode/README.md#build-tasks) the firmware.

3. Ensure JP38 (DVP CAM PWR) is connected to the "OFF" position.

4. Ensure JP41 (CSI CAM I2C EN) is _disconnected_.

5. Ensure JP35 (I2C1 SDA) and JP36 (I2C1 SCL) are _disconnected_.

11. Decrease image resolution and recapture.  The HM0360 requires switching the active context to one that has been configured for the target resolution.

    The active context is selected via register `0x3024`.

    * `0x3024 = 0` shows Context A is active (320x240).
