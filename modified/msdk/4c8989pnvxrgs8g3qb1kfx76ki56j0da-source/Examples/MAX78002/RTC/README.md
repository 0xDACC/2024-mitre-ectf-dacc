## Description

This example demonstrates the use of the Real Time Clock (RTC) and its alarm functionality.

The RTC is enabled and the sub-second alarm set to trigger every 250 ms.
(LED1) is toggled each time the sub-second alarm triggers.  The time-of-day alarm is set to 5 seconds.  When the time-of-day alarm triggers, the rate of the sub-second alarm is switched to 1000 ms.

(LED2) is toggled each time the time-of-day alarm triggers. The time-of-day alarm is then rearmed for another 5 sec.  Pressing SW4 will output the current value of the RTC to the console UART.

## Software

### Project Usage

Universal instructions on building, flashing, and debugging this project can be found in the **[MSDK User Guide](https://analog-devices-msdk.github.io/msdk/USERGUIDE/)**.

### Project-Specific Build Notes

(None - this project builds as a standard example)

## Required Connections

-   Connect a USB cable between the PC and the CN2 (USB/PWR) connector.
-   Connect the 5V power cable at (5V IN).
-   Close jumper (RX - P0.0) and (TX - P0.1) at Headers JP23 (UART 0 EN).
-   Open an terminal application on the PC and connect to the EV kit's console UART at 115200, 8-N-1.
-   Close jumper JP1 (LED1 EN).
-   Close jumper JP2 (LED2 EN).

## Expected Output

```
*************************** RTC Example ****************************

The RTC is enabled and the sub-second alarm set to trigger every 250 ms.
(LED1) is toggled each time the sub-second alarm triggers.

The time-of-day alarm is set to 5 seconds.  When the time-of-day alarm
triggers, the rate of the sub-second alarm is switched to 1000 ms.

(LED2) is toggled each time the time-of-day alarm triggers.

The time-of-day alarm is then rearmed for another 5 sec.  Pressing SW4
will output the current value of the RTC to the console UART.
