## Description

Simple program that demonstrates how to link static libraries to an application.

This demo application toggles an LED using GPIO functions found in the static library myLib.a. Refer
to project.mk to see how to include ".a" static library files into your project.

### Project-Specific Build Notes

(None - this project builds as a standard example)

## Required Connections

-   Connect a USB cable between the PC and the CN2 (USB/PWR) connector.
-   Connect the 5V power cable at (5V IN).
-   Close jumper (RX - P0.0) and (TX - P0.1) at Headers JP23 (UART 0 EN).
-   Close jumper JP1 (LED1 EN).
-   Close jumper JP2 (LED2 EN).
-   Open a terminal application on the PC and connect to the EV kit's console UART at 115200, 8-N-1.

## Expected Output

The Console UART of the device will output these messages:

```
