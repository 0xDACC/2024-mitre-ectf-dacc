## Description

This example captures an image using the camera (e.g. OV5640) via MIPI CSI-2 Protocol and streams either to the on-board TFT display or to your PC through the COM port. Press PB0 to capture an image once the device is ready.

Use the [utils/console.py](utils/console.py) script to grab the camera data and create a png image of the captured image. More information can be found in [utils/README.md](utils/README.md).

## Required Connections

- Connect a USB cable between the PC and the CN2 (USB/PWR) connector.
- Install JP41 (CSI2 CAM I2C EN)
- Install JP40 (HW PWUP/SW PWUP)
- Remove JP16 and JP17 (I2C1 SDA/I2C1 SL)
    - This is required to ensure the I2C1 bus is pulled up properly for the CSI2 camera.  Duplicate pull-ups result in unreliable camera communication.
- Connect the 5V power cable at (5V IN).
- Close jumper (RX - P0.0) and (TX - P0.1) at Headers JP23 (UART 0 EN).
- Open an terminal application on the PC and connect to the EV kit's console UART t 115200, 8-N-1.
- Close jumper JP1 (LED1 EN).
- Close jumper JP2 (LED2 EN).
