## Description

This example writes the CNN weights file `weights_2.h` into an SD card as a `weights_2.bin` binary file.  It is a sub-project of the [facial_recognition](../../facial_recognition/) project provided as an alternative way for users to load the SD card.  When paired with the facial_recognition demo it also demonstrates how to write weights and load CNN weights from an SD card.
