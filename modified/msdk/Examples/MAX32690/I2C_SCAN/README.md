## Description
This example uses the I2C Master to find the addresses of any I2C Slave devices connected to the same bus as I2C0.

## Software

### Project Usage

Universal instructions on building, flashing, and debugging this project can be found in the **[MSDK User Guide](https://analog-devices-msdk.github.io/msdk/USERGUIDE/)**.

### Project-Specific Build Notes

(None - this project builds as a standard example)

## Required Connections

-   Connect a USB cable between the PC and the CN2 (USB/PWR) connector.
-   Install JP7(RX_EN) and JP8(TX_EN) headers.
-   Open an terminal application on the PC and connect to the EV kit's console UART at 115200, 8-N-1.
-   Close jumper JP5 (LED1 EN).
-   Close jumper JP6 (LED2 EN).
-   Select the proper pullup voltage for I2C0 using jumper JP2.
-   Enable I2C0 pullup resistors by installing jumpers JP3 and JP4.
-   Connect I2C0 (SDA - P2.7, SCL - P2.8) to I2C bus.

## Expected Output

The Console UART of the device will output these messages:

```
******** I2C SLAVE ADDRESS SCANNER *********

This example finds the addresses of any I2C Slave devices connected to the
same bus as I2C0 (SDA - P2.7, SCL - P2.8). Select the proper voltage for
the I2C0 pullup resistors using jumper JP2 and enable them by installing
jumpers JP3 and JP4.
