## Description

This example demonstrates the capabilities of the I2S peripheral. This example demonstrates how to record audio from the on-board digital microphone and play the recorded audio back out through the headphone jack.

Once the green LED is illiuminated the system is ready to begin recording. Recording will start when button SW3 is pressed and will continue until the button is released or the external memory is full.

After the recording has finished the audio will begin playing after a 3 second delay.
