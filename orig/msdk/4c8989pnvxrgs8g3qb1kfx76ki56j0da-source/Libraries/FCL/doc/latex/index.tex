The Free Cryptographic Library (F\+CL) is a cryptographic library with source code. This source code can be used for demo or test purposes on P\+Cs, on or with embedded platforms. Implemented algorithms are currently\+: E\+C\+D\+SA signature and verification for P192, P256, P384, P521, B\+P256, B\+P384, B\+P512, S\+H\+A256, S\+H\+A384, S\+H\+A512 and S\+I\+A256. A\+ES encryption, decryption in E\+CB, C\+BC modes and C\+B\+C-\/\+M\+AC, for 128-\/bit, 192-\/bit and 256-\/bit keys. S\+H\+A3 is also available.

For more robust or specific cryptographic needs, see the Universal Cryptographic Library (U\+CL).

\begin{DoxyWarning}{Warning}
The F\+CL contains confidential documentation and code. It can be delivered as source code, even externally to Maxim. However, delivery to customers requires an N\+DA.
\end{DoxyWarning}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This software is only here for test and demo purposes.
\item This implementation is not secure and does not protect the E\+CC private/\+A\+ES secret keys.
\item The random number generator is not robust and will generate the same numbers at each startup (P\+R\+NG).
