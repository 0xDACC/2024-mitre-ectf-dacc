## Description

This example demonstrates the use of the Analog Comparator to wake up the device from deep sleep. 

The example is configured to use analog channels 3 and 7 as the negative and positive comparator inputs respectively. A wakeup event is triggered when the comparator output transitions from low to high (analog 7 needs to transition from a voltage lower than analog 3 to a voltage higher than analog 3).

## Software

### Project Usage

Universal instructions on building, flashing, and debugging this project can be found in the **[MSDK User Guide](https://analog-devices-msdk.github.io/msdk/USERGUIDE/)**.

### Project-Specific Build Notes

(None - this project builds as a standard example)

## Required Connections
-   Connect a USB cable between the PC and the CN1 (USB/PWR) connector.
-   Connect pins JP10(RX_SEL) and JP11(TX_SEL) to RX0 and TX0  header.
-   Open an terminal application on the PC and connect to the EV kit's console UART at 115200, 8-N-1.
-   Apply the negative comparator input to the pin labeled 3 of the JH1 (Analog) header.
-	Apply the positive comparator input to the pin labeled 7 of the JH2 (Analog) header.

## Expected Output

The Console UART of the device will output these messages:

```
********** Comparator Example **********

Connect the positive comparator input to analog pin 7 (P0.15).
Connect the negative comparator input to analog pin 3 (P0.11).

The device will repeatedly be placed in Deep Sleep and requires an edge
transition of the comparator output to wakeup.

Press any user push button to begin.
