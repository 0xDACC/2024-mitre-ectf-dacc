## Description

This example demonstrates reading and writing to an SD card using both 1-bit and 4-bit data buses and using both blocking and non-blocking methods.


## Software

### Project Usage

Universal instructions on building, flashing, and debugging this project can be found in the **[MSDK User Guide](https://analog-devices-msdk.github.io/msdk/USERGUIDE/)**.

### Project-Specific Build Notes

(None - this project builds as a standard example)

## Required Connections

-   Connect a USB cable between the PC and the CN2 (USB/PWR) connector.
-   Open an terminal application on the PC and connect to the EV kit's console UART at 115200, 8-N-1.
-	Insert a MicroSD card into EV Kit's SDHC slot.

## Expected Output

```
