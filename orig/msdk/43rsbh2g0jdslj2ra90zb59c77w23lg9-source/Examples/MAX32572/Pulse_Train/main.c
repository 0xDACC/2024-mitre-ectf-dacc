 * @brief Configures and starts four different pulse trains on GPIO LEDs.
 * @details LED0 - PT6 setup as 2Hz continuous signal that outputs 10110b
 *          LED1 - PT7 setup as 10Hz continuous square wave
 *          SW1 - push button setup to stop/start pulse trains
 *
 * @note Interrupts for pulse trains are enabled but the interrupt handler only clears the flags.
