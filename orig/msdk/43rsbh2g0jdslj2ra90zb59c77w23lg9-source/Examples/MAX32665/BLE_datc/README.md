## Software

### Project Usage

Universal instructions on building, flashing, and debugging this project can be found in the **[MSDK User Guide](https://analog-devices-msdk.github.io/msdk/USERGUIDE/)**.

### Required Connections
* Connect a USB cable between the PC and the (USB/PWR - UART) connector.

### Project-Specific Build Notes
* Setting `TRACE=1` in [**project.mk**](project.mk) initializes the on-board USB-to-UART adapter for
viewing the trace messages and interacting with the application. Port uses settings:
    - Baud            : 115200  
    - Char size       : 8  
    - Parity          : None  
    - Stop bits       : 1  
    - HW Flow Control : No  
    - SW Flow Control : No  
* Upon server discovery the user will be prompted to enter a passkey.
An arbitrary pin can be entered in the format `pin (connId) passkey` 
    * Example: `pin 1 123456`
    * The server is expected to enter the same connId and passkey to establish a secure connection
    and share bonding information
    * ***Note***: *Either the client or server can enter the passkey first. The peer device must then match.*
